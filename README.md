## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge made me understand little by little how Flexbox works.

### Continued development

I need to understand better the concept of Flexbox since it's really useful for creating layouts. Another thing is, to get better as well in Responsive Web Designing and Media Queries.
